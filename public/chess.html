    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
        Chess is a game played by two players where both players take
        control of 16 pieces each. The pieces are divided into two
        colors, white and black, and the game is played on an 8x8 board.
        Both players try to checkmate the other's king by moving the pieces
        around. Pieces can be moved to the locations of the opponents'
        pieces, and when this happens, the piece can be taken. Each piece
        moves differently. To win the game, a player needs to checkmate their opponent's king.
        A checkmate occurs when the king gets put into a check and can't
        escape from it. A king can escape a check by moving out of the way,
        blocking the check with another piece, or capturing the piece that
        checked the king. If the king can't escape by any of listed methods,
        then the game is over.
    </p>

    <p>
        The earliest known predecessor of chess was being played around
        1,500 years ago in India. This game was called chaturanga.
        Then, the game spread to Persia where it was called Shatranj
        and was picked up by the Muslim world and to Europe through Spain
        and Italy. Around 1,500 CE is when chess began developing into
        its current form. After its development, "Romantic chess" was the
        version that was played the most from the late 18th century up to the
        late 1800s.

    <h2>Rules</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Kings can only move one space in any of the eight
            directions on the board if possible. The opponent
            attacking the king will result in a check, and the
            king can't willingly get itself into a check position.
        </li>

        <li>
            Queens can move in any direction like the king, but
            unlike the king, it can move more than one space.
            However, the queen can't go through pieces of the
            same color, so if a piece is on the path of the queen,
            it can only go up to the piece. Also, if the queen
            captures a piece, then the turn is over.
        </li>

        <li>
            Rooks can move more than one space, but it can only
            move to the non-diagonal sides. They're particularly
            powerful when they're near each other.
        </li>

        <li>
            Bishops can move more than one space as well but only in
            diagonal directions. The bishop either starts on a
            light or dark space, and they can only stay on those
            spaces throughout the game.
        </li>

        <li>
            Knights move in an L-shaped direction: two spaces in
            one direction and one more space perpendicular to the
            first two spaces. These pieces can also move over other
            pieces.
        </li>

        <li>
            Pawns move forward, but for them to capture other pieces,
            they need to move diagonally. For their first turn, pawns
            can move two spaces forward. After this, they can only
            move one space forward.
        </li>
    </ul>
